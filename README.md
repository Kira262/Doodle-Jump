Doodle Jump is a simple and fun vertical platformer game built using the SimpleGUI library. The game features a doodle character that jumps on platforms to climb as high as possible while avoiding falling off the screen. This game is implemented in Python and designed to be run in the browser using the SimpleGUI library.
